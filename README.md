Project Title: Library Management System (OOP-based)

Description:
The Library Management System is a Java-based mini application designed to manage books and users using the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This system allows librarians or administrators to handle essential library operations such as issuing and returning books in a simplified manner.
The project is built using multiple classes — Book, User, and Library — to ensure modularity, code reusability, and clear separation of concerns. The Library class acts as the central management unit, maintaining records of books and their availability.

Key Features:
Book Management: Store book details like title, author, and availability status.
User Management: Maintain user information for tracking issued books.
Issue Books: Allow a user to borrow a book if available.
Return Books: Enable users to return borrowed books and update the inventory accordingly.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Java
IDE: Eclipse IDE
Execution Environment: Command-line Terminal
